The IDA is a member of the\nWorld Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in\n1960 to complement the existing International Bank for Reconstruction and Development by lending to\ndeveloping countries which suffer from the lowest gross national income, from troubled\ncreditworthiness, or from the lowest per capita income. Together, the International Development\nAssociation and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development are collectively generally\nknown as the World Bank, as they follow the same executive leadership and operate with the same\nstaff.The association shares the World Bank's mission of reducing poverty and aims to provide\naffordable development financing to countries whose credit risk is so prohibitive that they cannot afford\nto borrow commercially or from the Bank's other programs. The IDA's stated aim is to assist the\npoorest nations in growing more quickly, equitably, and sustainably to reduce poverty. The IDA is the\nsingle largest provider of funds to economic and human development projects in the world's poorest\nnations. From 2000 to 2010, it financed projects which recruited and trained 3 million teachers,\nimmunized 310 million children, funded $792 million in loans to 120,000 small and medium enterprises,\nbuilt or restored 118,000 kilometers of paved roads, built or restored 1,600 bridges, and expanded\naccess to improved water to 113 million people and improved sanitation facilities to 5.8 million people.\nThe IDA has issued a total $238 billion USD in loans and grants since its launch in 1960.
