Though\nphysiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally\nassociated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby\nisland of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors\nbegan migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the\nisland.Greenland is the world's largest island. Australia and Antarctica, although larger, are generally\nconsidered to be continental landmasses rather than islands. Three-quarters of Greenland is covered\nby the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of about 56,480 (2013), it is the\nleast densely populated territory in the world. About a third of the population live in Nuuk, the capital\nand largest city. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the\nvarious cities and settlements.\n"}, {"id": 228, "score": 0.020473341460599655, "title": "Dominica Population", "description": "Coordinates: 15\u00b025\u00a2N 61\u00b020\u00a2Wn / n15.417\u00b0N 61.333\u00b0Wn / 15.417; -61.333in the Caribbean  (light\nyellow)Dominica (/dnnmnnnnkn/ ( listen) or /ndnmnnninkn/; French: Dominique; Island Carib:\nWai\u201atu kubuli), officially the Commonwealth of Dominica, is an island republic.
