Cyprus is located south of Turkey,\nwest of Syria and Lebanon, northwest of Israel, north of Egypt, and southeast of Greece.The earliest\nknown human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC. Archaeological remains\nfrom this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some\nof the oldest water wells in the world. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the\n2nd millennium BC. As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several\nmajor powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island\nwas seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and\nEastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the\nVenetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until\n1914).\n"

Their growth and development is also held back by high\ncommunication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes,\ndisproportionately expensive public administration and infrastructure due to their small size, and little to\nno opportunity to create economies of scale.The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of\ndeveloping countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June\n1992. The Barbados Programme of Action was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their\nsustainable development efforts. The United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States\n(UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states.\n"

North America is the third largest continent by\narea, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. In 2013, its\npopulation was estimated at nearly 565 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the\nworld's population, if nearby islands (most notably the Caribbean) are included.North America was\nreached by its first human populations during the last glacial period, via crossing the Bering land bridge\napproximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted\nuntil about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period). The Classic stage\nspans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The Pre-Columbian era ended in 1492, and the transatlantic\nmigrations -- the arrival of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period.\nPresent-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kinds of interactions between European\ncolonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves and their descendants.\n"

In 1856, southern Bessarabia was\nreturned to Moldavia, which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania, but Russian rule\nwas restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 Russian Revolution, Bessarabia\nbriefly became an autonomous and then independent Moldavian Democratic Republic until it was\nintegrated into Romania in 1918 following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by Soviet\nRussia, which, in 1924, allowed the establishment, within the Ukrainian SSR, of a Moldavian\nautonomous republic (MASSR) on partial Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of the Dniester. In\n1940, as a consequence of the Molotov\u0152Ribbentrop Pact, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia\nto the Soviet Union, leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian\nSSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR.\n"

On 24 February 1918 independence was\ndeclared and later secured through War of Independence. After democratic rule from 1918 to 1934,\nEstonia became autocratic during the Era of Silence. During World War II, Estonia suffered successive\noccupations by Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and Soviet Union again, resulting in its annexation as the\nEstonian SSR. After the loss of its de facto independence, Estonia's de jure state continuity was\npreserved by diplomats and government in exile. In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution against\nSoviet rule began, culminating with restoration of its de facto independence on 20 August 1991.

Reykjav\u00edk and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over\ntwo-thirds of the population.Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a\nplateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow\nto the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate,\ndespite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep\nsummers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.According to the ancient\nmanuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k, the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain\nIng\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island. In the following centuries,\nNorwegians, and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them\nthralls (i.e., slaves or serfs) of Gaelic origin. The island was governed as an independent\ncommonwealth under the Althing, one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies.\nFollowing a period of civil strife, Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The\nestablishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.\nIceland thus followed Norway's integration to that union and came under Danish rule, after Sweden's\nsecession from that union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in\n1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures\nwere conspicuous by their absence. In the wake of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars,\nIceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the\nfounding of a republic in 1944. Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and\nagriculture, and was among the poorest countries in Europe. Industrialisation of the fisheries and\nMarshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity, and Iceland became one of the wealthiest\nand most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the European Economic Area,\nwhich further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.\n"

During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining\ndominated by regional caudillos (military strongmen) until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the\ncountry has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to\nseveral political crises, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and\nthe impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A\ncollapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former coup-involved career\nofficer Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution. The revolution began with a 1999\nConstituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was written. This new constitution\nofficially changed the name of the country to Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic\nof Venezuela).\n"

Named Santiago, the island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later\nGreat Britain) conquered it and renamed it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a\nleading sugar exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on slaves forcibly transported\nfrom Africa. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have\nsubsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British utilized\nChinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from\nthe United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.\n"

It is a\nsecular, unitary constitutional republic, comprising 12 provinces, one autonomous republic, and a\ncapital city. Uzbekistan is bordered by five landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Kyrgyzstan\nto the northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast; Afghanistan to the south; and Turkmenistan to the\nsouthwest.What is now Uzbekistan was in ancient times part of the predominantly Iranian-speaking\nregion of Transoxiana, with cities such as Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva growing rich from the Silk\nRoad. The first settlers to this territory are known as Scythians. The earliest civilizations include\nKhwarezm (8th\u01526th centuries BC), Bactria (8th\u01526th centuries BC), Sogdia (8th\u01526th centuries BC),\nFergana (3rd century BC \u0152 6th century AD), and Margiana (3rd century BC \u0152 6th century AD), founded\nby the East Iranian nomads. The area was incorporated into the Persian Empire, which saw its fall with\nthe Muslim conquest in the 7th century, turning the majority of the population into Islam. Following the\nsuccession of the local rulers of Khwarezmian dynasty in the 11th century, the region fell to the Mongol\ninvasion in the 13th century. The city of Shahrisabz was the birthplace of Timur, who in 14th century\nestablished the Timurid Empire and was proclaimed the Supreme Emir of Turan. The area was\nconquered by Uzbek Shaybanids in the 16th century, moving the centre of power from Samarkand to\nBukhara. The region was split into three states: Khanate of Khiva, Khanate of Kokand, and Emirate of\nBukhara. It was gradually incorporated into the Russian Empire during the 19th century, with Tashkent\nbecoming the political center of Russian Turkestan. In 1924, after national delimitation, the constituent\nrepublic of the Soviet Union known as the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic was created. Following the\nbreakup of the Soviet Union, it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August\n1991.\n"

Strategies of increasing income to make basic\nneeds more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms and providing financial services.\n"

In Weberian socio-economic\nterms, the middle class is the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall\nsocio-economically between the working class and upper class. The common measures of what\nconstitutes middle class vary significantly among cultures. A sizable and healthy middle-class can be\nviewed as a characteristic of a healthy society.The term \"middle class\" is first attested in James\nBradshaw's 1745 pamphlet Scheme to prevent running Irish Wools to France. Another phrase used in\nEarly modern Europe was \"the middling sort\".The term \"middle class\" has had several, sometimes\ncontradictory, meanings. It was once defined by exception as an intermediate social class between the\nnobility and the peasantry of Europe.[by whom?] While the nobility owned the countryside, and the\npeasantry worked the countryside, a new bourgeoisie (literally \"town-dwellers\") arose around\nmercantile functions in the city. In France, the middle classes helped drive the French Revolution.\nAnother definition equated the middle class to the original meaning of capitalist: someone with so much\ncapital that they could rival nobles. In fact, to be a capital-owning millionaire was the essential criterion\nof the middle class in the industrial revolution.\n"

It has an area of 4,475,757 km2 (1,728,099 sq mi), and an estimated population of\nover 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of\nlaws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods,\nservices, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and\nmaintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the\nSchengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999\nand came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro\ncurrency.The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the\nEuropean Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and\n1957 Treaty of Rome. The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities,\nwere the Inner Six; Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The\nCommunities and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in\npower by the addition of policy areas to its remit. While no member state has left the EU or its\nantecedent organisations, the United Kingdom enacted the result of a membership referendum in June\n2016 and is currently negotiating its withdrawal. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union\nin 1993 and introduced European citizenship. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis\nof the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.\n"
